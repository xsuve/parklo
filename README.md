# parklo - Community Parking Spot Sharing Mobile App
parklo is an app I wanted to develop to solve my own car parking problem. Whenever I drove to the university I was facing the same problem everyday - where do I park my car now, if there a spot available in an area, should I risk myself and park closer to the university or park right over where I found a spot? I thought at parklo to be like Waze. Therefore users are able to 'share' their parking spot. You would park in a spot, estimate an amount of time that particular spot would be occupied so it will become available again on the map after that time expires and other users would have seen it.
